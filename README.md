# Flappy Bird.js

     My First Project made all over JavaScript, using HTML and CSS.

     Basic copy of the game Flappy Bird, where the objective is to dodge the obstacles by pressing the jump key to do it. 

     Jump key is set to SPACE BAR only, you cannot jump by another key in your keyboard. 

     The reason why I made this projetct, is to improve my knowledge on JS and to test myself on what I'm up to.
